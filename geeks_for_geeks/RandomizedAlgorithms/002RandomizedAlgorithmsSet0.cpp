This leads to the famous Baye's formula which is kind of the reverse/inverse of conditional probability, as in it tries to find out the cause given the future event has happened, in contrast to conditional probability tries to find the probability of the future event happening given that the cause has happened

Random variables, are neither random nor are they variables, they are in fact deterministic functions, that are crucial in studying probability distributions better because these functions allow us to move from a set notation of a sample space to a real number line 

These random variables, since they map everything to numbers, we can perform operations on these numbers and find out some interesting properties, like the expected value and variance. 

Expectation value is the most common concept in the study of random variables and hence studying its properties is of utmost importance. The most fundamental and powerful property is that the expected value is a linear operator.
